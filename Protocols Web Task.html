      <h3><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</strong> (HTTPs)</h3>
      <p> HTTPS is the better option out of HTTP and HTTPS as it is more secure. The HTTPS protocals allows files to be transmitted through a safe encrypted connection. This therefore prevents
        the likelyhood of any files being stolen between the transfer process between server and browser.

      <h3><strong>Transport Layer Security and Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (TLS/SSL)</h3>
     <p>TSL also known as SSL is a protocal that encrypts data that is sent via the internet. It checks and verifies the users and therefore provides end-to-end security to ensure that 
      the private and sensitive information that may be sent across is unable to be intercepted by hackers.
